# downloading-history-data-of-listed-nse-stocks-using-nsepy
Here I am using multi-threading so that all 1500+ stocks data will be fetched quickly and will be stored in .csv files. It is absolutely free.

Currently I am downloading data of past 2 months, but there is some issue with nsepy, if I will try to download last history data say of 1 year or 5 years it shows multiple warnings, but data gets accurately downloaded. 

To overcome this I will soon upload program to download same data, but using different API(yahoo finance will be used)
